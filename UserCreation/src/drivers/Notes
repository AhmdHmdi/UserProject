Disable insecure password on firefox
    Open a new tab, paste about:config into the address bar and hit enter.
    If you see the “This Might Void Your Warranty” page, click the blue “I accept the risk!” button. Understand we are manually modifying Firefox’s default settings.
    In the Search box at the top, paste security.insecure_field_warning.contextual.enabled

    Double click the setting to change it to “false”, to disable Firefox’s insecure password warning.
    Done! Now when you visit pages with HTTP login forms, the warning will no longer appear.
